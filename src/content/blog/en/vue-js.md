# Introduction

There is no question that Vue JS is gaining popularity at the moment. According to a study conducted in 2017, 47 percent of developers want to learn this JavaScript platform. What's even more interesting is that almost 90% of programmers who have used this platform in the past state that they will use it again in future ventures.

**Quick fact**: Vue.js is one of the most common progressive technologies for designing user interfaces, with over 128,752 stars on GitHub, outnumbering React and Angular.

Now that we have seen the astonishing stats of this platform, let's delve into why Vue JS is becoming a preferred choice.

Vue is capable of adapting and can be effectively incorporated into large programs for frontend production without posing any external obstacles.

**Reasons To Choose The VueJS Framework**

Vue has everything you need to make programming quick and uncomplicated. One of the key advantages is its gradual learning curve. Additionally, Vue is adaptable, lightweight, and scalable.

Vue also provides incredible tools, efficient state control, and routing solutions. Its architecture allows for incredible production speed thanks to a large range of plugins that can address crucial problems in each program, enabling cost-effective and quick product design.

The advantages of using Vue.js technologies in web creation are mentioned below.

**1. Saves time**

The Vue CLI, a technology developed and sponsored by the Vue Core Group, is another explanation for Vue's growing success. It aids in reducing the time spent by designers on the program's setup process.

Vue CLI provides a project creator that makes starting a new project a breeze. It facilitates the development of a project specification in a limited amount of time by creating a project using a series of questions about the project's requirements.

Many additional features can be added later by developers via plugins, encouraging them to add only the features that are truly required as new specifications arise.

**2. Integration is easy**

Vue.js has one of the strongest integration features for current apps, which explains its enormous success in the tech community.

Since Vue is based on JavaScript, it can be quickly combined with other JavaScript-based apps. This allows you to easily modify existing programs as well as build new ones, thanks to the already existing materials.

**3. The learning curve is gentle**

A gentle learning curve is essential for any developer. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS can all be learned and understood at a basic level. If you are building complex web applications, gaining experience with these languages can make it easier for you.

Vue.js is readily accessible during development and assists Vue.js programmers in unleashing their creativity by offering an additional syntax extension.

**4. Mobile app development**

Vue delivers powerful cross-platform UI architecture strategies. Alibaba's smartphone app, which is built with Vue, is one of the finest examples of e-commerce. The user interface can be controlled across various channels with repeatability and transparency, which is fantastic.

**5. Thoroughly specified framework**

Vue's well-defined environment is a big plus because it allows users to effectively choose a solution to the current challenge. There is no need to waste a lot of time searching for the right one. Despite focusing on layered architecture, Vue can solve common problems with the help of Vue Router, Vuex, Vue CLI, and Vue Test Utils.

This speeds up production while simultaneously unifying it across many programs. Since most projects use the same methods, it is often easier for developers to jump straight in instead of spending time studying these resources.

Vue's progressively modular ecosystem ranges between a platform and a repository, making it an excellent choice for any project.

**6. Highly Versatile**

The Vuex functionality is used for state control and routing, allowing for the creation of more complex and advanced capabilities. The big distinction between Vuex and Redux/Flux with React is that Vue's partner libraries are publicly supported and maintain the core library up to date.

Although Redux and Flux are extensions of the React ecosystem, they are not explicitly related to React.

**7. Adaptability**

In Vue, the user experience, as well as the patented reactivity mechanism, can be revamped dynamically. This saves developers time as they do not have to spend as much time on extra coding. Instead, they can focus on efficiency and other important characteristics.

**8. A thriving community**

The Vue community is actively growing and contributing to the framework's growth. Vue's developer comrades around the globe are assisting in spreading knowledge about the framework. The 2017 VueConf in Wroclaw, Poland, sparked a Vue-related event storm around the world.

**9. Easy to use**

Vue.js is a relatively modern technology compared to other frameworks. One of its key highlights is its ease of use and lack of bloat. Vue deserves recognition for its ability to avoid unnecessary complexity. Developers can focus on enhancements rather than repairs because Vue has a small surface area.

**Which Companies Are Using VueJS?**

If you are looking for a JavaScript platform, it is comforting to know that top businesses are currently using Vue JS. Whether you are a developer or a company owner who needs to be secure about the technologies they invest in, the following companies have adopted Vue.js: Alibaba, Xiaomi, Grammarly, Adobe, Louis Vuitton, Google, and Netflix. Vue is used for a large number of websites, components, extensions, frameworks, and models.

**Conclusion**


Choose a successful Vue JS development company as your production partner to work with the best professionals in the industry without a doubt.

This is because, regardless of how successful the system is or how practical it is, the majority of the project's progress is determined by who is implementing it and how they work. So, make an informed decision and consider the consequences.
